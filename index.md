You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KyleBricker/kylebricker.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KyleBricker/kylebricker.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

##Favorite Pokemon
This is a small website that allows a user to browse all pokemon, whose data is retrieved from the PokeAPI, sort them by type and region, and choose their favorites, which are saved to their user account.

##Scar Wars Playlist Creator
This website allows multiple users to collaborate on creating a collection of playlists made up of songs that fit a certain pattern. It was inspired by my friend who made many of these albums. Each one had: 16 songs, started with a song that was the opening to something, ended with a song in a foriegn language, had at least one song from every decade since the 60s, was between 50 and 60 minutes total, had a disney song, and an intrumental song, and most importantly, never repeated any artists across all the playlists. This deployment-ready project will keep track of all these rules itself, and tell a user if they have made an invalid playlist.
